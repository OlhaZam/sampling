# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The target population are employees in entry- and lower-level (junior) positions across all departments. While there are potential challenges to ensuring that the data is representative of the target population, careful planning and execution of the survey process can cover many of these issues. By employing a robust sampling method, encouraging high participation, and addressing potential biases, we can achieve a high degree of representativeness in the collected data. 
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    In the previous version of the survey, I included both current and former junior employees. However, this approach could be challenging and impact the timeline and quality of the survey, as it requires locating and contacting former employees and relying on their willingness to cooperate. After further consideration, I recommend focusing the survey solely on current employees, who are more easily accessible and likely to participate.

    Changes and Reasoning:
        1. Focus on Current Employees: Removed questions intended for former employees to streamline the survey and focus solely on current employees, ensuring accessibility and higher response rates.

        2. Clarity and Specificity: Maintained the improvements in clarity and specificity from the previous revision, ensuring questions are straightforward and easy to understand.

        3. Survey Quality: Added questions about job satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors to gain deeper insights into the reasons behind employee satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

        4. Error Reduction: Ensured language is clear and options are exhaustive to reduce misinterpretation and improve the reliability and validity of responses.
        
        5. Ethical Considerations: Ensured questions are respectful and avoid leading language, and emphasized anonymity and confidentiality to encourage honest feedback.

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, an observational study alone would not be sufficient to fulfill the purpose of the survey. 
    
    While observational studies can provide valuable contextual information and identify visible patterns of behavior, they are limited in capturing subjective insights, such as personal feelings, motivations, and perceptions, which are crucial for understanding job satisfaction and reasons for turnover. For example, observers might note high turnover but cannot determine whether it is due to dissatisfaction with management, lack of career development, or personal reasons.
