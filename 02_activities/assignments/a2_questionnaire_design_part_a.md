# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
As a member of the Human Resources Department, we want to understand why over the past few months there is a high turnover rate across different departnments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The main purpose is to understand why this happening and what changes need to be implemented to improve employee satisfaction.

```
Target population: Employees in entry- and lower-level (junior) positions across all departments.

Sampling frame: The list of all departments within the company.

Sampling units: Individuals, which connected to specific departments.

Observational units: Current and former junior employees.


The Sampling Method:

Stratified Random Sampling: Given that turnover rates and reasons may vary across departments, it is important to ensure representation from all departments. Stratify the sample by department and by current/former status of employment and then randomly select individuals within each stratum.
Steps:
Stratify: Divide the sampling frame into strata based on departments and status.
Random Selection: Within each stratum, randomly select a proportionate number of individuals.
