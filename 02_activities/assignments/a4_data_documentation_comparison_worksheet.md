| Sample type                                           |    The sample is based on a stratified design employing probability sampling. The stratification is done at the province/census metropolitan area (CMA) level. GSS uses a two-stage sampling design.                                                                                        |    Two-wave panel survey methodology combined with a modified rolling-cross section design. The online sample for the study was stratified by region, gender, and age to ensure representation across these variables.                                         |    A variety of approaches, including field surveys, captive behavioural experiments, acoustic analyses and genetic methods to assess niche flexibility in G. soricina and describe the behavioural and acoustic mechanisms of insect capture and the species of insects targeted.                                                                                         |
| Sample size                                           |      A field sample of approximatively 50,000 units was used. Among them, about 40,000 invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent to selected households across Canada. A completion of 24,000 questionnaires was expected.                                                                                      |    Pre-election survey: 37,822 Post-election survey: 10,337                                         |     75 faecal samples from G. soricina in Belize                                                                                        |
| Target population                                     |    All persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. It excludes full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.                                                                                        |  Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older.                                           |     Glossophaga soricina.                                                                                        |
| Sampling frame                                        |    Landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address (or single telephone number in the case a link between a telephone number and an address could not be established). This sampling frame is used to obtain a better coverage of households with a telephone number.                                                                                        |   The sampling frame for the 2019 Canadian Election Study was an online panel managed by Qualtrics. This panel consists of individuals who have opted to participate in online surveys, providing a basis for drawing the study sample.                                          |   The study sampled bats from different locations including Costa Rica and Belize. The sampling frame also consists of bats from a captive colony.                                                                                          |
| Survey mode(s)                                        |     Data are collected directly from survey respondents either through an electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing). No proxy reporting is allowed. The respondents has the choice between French and English. The average time to complete the survey is estimated at 44 minutes.                                                                                       |      CES was conducted in two modes—a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone survey (n = 4,021) and a large-scale online collection (n = 37,822). The online sample was composed of a two-wave panel with a modified rolling-cross section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact Wave.                                       |       Field Surveys; Captive Behavioural Experiments; Acoustic Analyses; Genetic Methods                                                                                      |
| Timeline                                              |    2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28                                                                                        |    09.13.2019 - 11.11.2019                                         |     Dietary Analysis: a 7-week period from late May to early July 2009                                                                                        |
| Response rate                                         |   The overall response rate is 41.9%.                                                                                         | N/A                                            |      Only a third of captured individuals produced a faecal pellet.                                                                                       |
| Weights                                               |    A weighting factor is available on the microdata file: WGHT_PER: This is the basic weighting factor for analysis at the person level, i.e. to calculate estimates of the number of persons (non-institutionalized and aged 15 or over) having one or several given characteristics. In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.                                                                                        | The dataset includes the weights produced as 4 variables, depending on which portion of the sample is being used: 1. cps19_weight_general_all - all campaign period respondents; 2. cps19_weight_general_restricted - only high-quality campaign period respondents (see Data Quality section below); 3. pes19_weight_general_all - all post-election survey respondents 4. pes19_weight_general_restricted - only high-quality post-election survey respondents.                                            |       N/A                                                                                      |
| Data processing                                       |         Processing used the SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities to allow subject matter and survey support staff to specify and run the processing of the survey in a timely fashion with high quality outputs. It used a structured environment to monitor the processing of data ensuring best practices and harmonized business processes were followed. The CATI data capture program allowed a valid range of codes for each question and built-in edits, and automatically follows the flow of the questionnaire. All survey records were subjected to computer edits throughout the course of the interview. The CATI system principally edited the flow of the questionnaire and identified out of range values.                                                                                   |        All web data collection was completed on the Advanis proprietary survey platform.                                      |    Data Collection: Field surveys and captive experiments involved collecting data on the diet of G. soricina, behavioral observations, and acoustic analyses. Data Analysis: Data from field surveys were analyzed to determine the proportion of insects in the diet of G. soricina. Captive behavioral data were analyzed for observations related to feeding behavior and handling times.                                                                                         |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |   Imputation: Except in a few cases, all imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function. Imputation was carried out in nine steps. The first step consisted of imputing personal income and family income. The next three steps involved imputing the formal volunteering variables in the master file. Steps five and six were imputing the informal volunteering variables in the master file. Finally, the last three steps involved imputing variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file.                                                                                         |  Incomplete responses, duplicate responses of previous respondents, speeders, those who “straight-lined” grid questions (“straightliners”), and respondents whose postal code didn’t match their province have all been removed from the data file, and are excluded from numbers reported in this codebook. During the data cleaning process, respondents were categorized based on their most important reason for removal.                                           |     N/A                                                                                        |
| Sources of error                                      |   Sampling Error: As the data are based on a sample of persons, they are subject to sampling error. That is, estimates based on a sample will vary from sample to sample, and typically they will be different from the results that would have been obtained from a complete census. More precise estimates of the sampling variability of estimates can be produced with the bootstrap method using bootstrap weights that have been created for this survey. Coverage errors (or imperfect coverage) arise when there are differences between the target population and the surveyed population. Households without telephones, as well as households with telephone services not covered by the current frame, represent a part of the target population that was excluded from the surveyed population. To the extent that the excluded population differs from the rest of the target population, the results may be biased. Non-response could occur at several stages in this survey. There were two stages of information collection: at the household level and at the individual level. Some non-response occurred at the household level, and some at the individual level. Survey estimates will be adjusted (i.e., weighted) to account for non-response cases.                                                                                         |       N/A                                      |   Only half of the insects were identified to species level, as the reference data base for the area is comprised almost exclusively of Lepidoptera. All of the identifiable prey were noctuids. The rest were likely Coleoptera and Diptera, in which a sense of hearing is not as widespread as in noctuids and thus can be caught without specialized echolocation. Species of insect identified in the diet of G. soricina were not associated with bat-pollinated flowers (Daniel Janzen, personal communication), supporting our conclusion that G. soricina actively hunts insects rather than opportunistically consuming prey present on flowers while the bat is feeding on nectar.                                                                                          |
| Limitations, known biases                             |  Non-response bias: The main method used to reduce nonresponse bias involved a series of adjustments to the survey weights to account for nonresponse as much as possible. For the 2018 GSS, an additional adjustment was added where basic characteristics of non-responding households, such as income and household composition, were extracted from administrative sources and then used to model and adjust nonresponse.                                                                                          |            N/A                                  |      The study acknowledges that call intensity measurements in a flight room may underestimate the actual call intensity of G. soricina in the wild, as bats often reduce call intensity in confinement. To account for this, the model is biased in favor of the moth, using very sensitive hearing thresholds of 55 and 75 dB SPL for the A1 and A2 cells. This conservative approach likely underestimates the bat's echo-acoustic advantage over its prey. Despite these biases, the model indicates that a more than 30-dB intensity increase in wild bats would be needed to elicit a response in the moth's A2 cell at the same detection distance, suggesting that slightly higher source levels in wild bats would not significantly alter the study's conclusions about G. soricina's stealth capabilities.                                                                                      |
